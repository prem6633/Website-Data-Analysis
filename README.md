# Website-Data-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing website user interaction data to understand visitor behavior and engagement patterns. The dataset includes metrics such as user sessions, traffic sources, page views, bounce rates, and session durations.
Using tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project involved:

Tracking user sessions over time

Identifying top traffic sources and user acquisition channels

Analyzing engagement metrics like time on site and bounce rate

Visualizing trends by date and channel group

The data was cleaned and structured for analysis, including handling missing values and reformatting date-time fields. Various visualizations were created to interpret user behavior and highlight areas for potential improvement in the website's performance.
